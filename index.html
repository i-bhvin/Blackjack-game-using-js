                The objective of blackjack is to have a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer's hand total, without
                exceeding 21. If your hand exceeds 21, it results in a bust and you lose the hand.
            </li>
            <li>
                The numerical value of each card is as follows: number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face
                cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and the Ace card is worth 11.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each round has a cost of $100, and if you win, you will receive a payout of $300.
            </li>
